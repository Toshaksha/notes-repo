### ‚úçÔ∏è  Overview

These notes are part of my personal learning journey as I explored and practiced Python. I created this notebook to reinforce my understanding and build a practical, go-to reference for key concepts. If you're a beginner or revisiting Python ‚Äî I hope you find it helpful too!

## üîç What‚Äôs Inside?

### 1. Python Basics  
- Introduction to Python and its features  
- Syntax and indentation rules  
- Comments in Python (single-line and multi-line)

### 2. Variables and Data Types  
- Variables and naming conventions  
- Built-in data types: integers, floats, strings, booleans, None  
- Type checking and typecasting  
- Arithmetic and assignment operators

### 3. String Handling  
- String creation, indexing, slicing  
- Common string methods: `.lower()`, `.upper()`, `.strip()`, `.replace()`, `.split()`  

### 4. Control Flow  
- Boolean values and logical operations  
- Conditional statements: if, elif, else  
- Looping constructs: `while` loops, `for` loops, and `for-else`  
- Loop control: `break`, `continue`, `pass`  

### 5. Data Structures  
- Lists: creation, indexing, methods like `.append()`, `.sort()`, `.remove()`, etc.  
- Tuples: immutable sequences and their methods  
- Sets: properties, operations, and methods  
- Dictionaries: key-value pairs, methods, and common operations  

### 6. Functions  
- Defining and calling functions  
- Parameters, default arguments, and return values  
- Recursion basics with examples (e.g., factorial)

### 7. File Handling  
- Opening, reading, writing, and closing files  
- File modes explained  
- Using `with` statement for safe file handling  

### 8. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Classes and objects  
- Constructors (`__init__`) and the `self` parameter  
- Instance vs class attributes  
- Methods, static methods, and class methods  
- Inheritance and the `super()` function  
- Encapsulation, abstraction, and data hiding  
- Abstract base classes  

### 9. Modules and Packages  
- Using built-in modules (`math`, `random`, `datetime`, `os`, `sys`)  
- Creating and importing your own modules  
- Packages and the `__init__.py` file  
- Managing dependencies and third-party packages with `pip`
